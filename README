For this assignment I set up post-processing in WebGL and created a CRT shader.

While not relevant to this assignment in general I also really improved my
model loader, which can now have nested meshes and multiple materials.

You can change shaders using the left buttons and change world positions using the right buttons.
You can rotate the camera by clicking and dragging on the screen.

The temple of time is a direct and this time unmodified (minus changing formats)
model from the N64 game LoZ: Ocarina of Time :)
