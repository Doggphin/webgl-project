# webgl-project

A work-in-progress website I used for a couple of weekly assignments in my computer graphics course in Spring 2024.

This website includes real-time 3D rendering with .GLTF model and texture loading using WebGL and JS along with several post-processing shader effects, such as a CRT shader and flames following the mouse.

## Instructions:

Controls:
 - Look around by clicking and dragging the mouse.
 - Select shaders by clicking buttons on the left.
 - Select viewpoints by clicking buttons on the right.

To run using Node.js:
```
http-server <directory>
```

## Screenshots:
